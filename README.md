'modularized' scripts for running liggghts sims

This script file (potentially this will be plural in teh future) contains some functions to make liggghts input scripts more compact. They are rather static right now and mostly deal with the 'box' configurations I deal with in ceramic breeder blankets for fusion. There's not much documentation for the script itself but I try to make the function names self-explanatory so they can be read through and adapted to future simulations.
